Monday, [Date]

Today was a pretty routine day, which honestly felt kind of nice. I stuck closely to my schedule all day—no deviations, no distractions. I woke up at the student accommodation and had breakfast there, just like usual. The familiar setting and quiet morning helped me ease into the day without any stress.

After breakfast, I planned to head to my morning classes on campus. It wasn’t a smooth walk, though—my usual path was blocked, so I had to find a different route. It was a bit frustrating at first, but I stayed calm and figured out where to go without rushing. Once I arrived at the college campus, I settled in for my classes, ready to focus. The classes were engaging enough, and I managed to keep my attention on the lectures and notes, which felt good. I hate falling behind, so I try really hard to stay on top of things.

By lunchtime, I headed to the downtown cafe, but again, my usual path was blocked. It’s odd how many blockages there were today. Still, I found a new way and made it there without too much trouble. Eating lunch at the cafe was a nice break from the campus atmosphere; the quiet hum of conversation around me gave a subtle buzz that I actually like. After lunch, I went back to campus for my afternoon classes. I spent most of the afternoon focused on studying and catching up on assignments. Sometimes I find it hard to stay completely focused for hours, but today I pushed through and got a lot done.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation, which felt comfortable and familiar. I like having my meals there—it’s predictable and relaxing. After dinner, according to my schedule, it was time to socialize at the park. However, I ran into the same problem with blocked paths again, so I couldn’t get to Central Park as planned. Instead, I ended up chatting briefly with Charlie Davis a few times. He came over and we had some nice, casual conversations. It’s not like I’m super outgoing, but talking with Charlie felt easy and not draining, which is rare for me. I finished each conversation feeling okay—neither exhausted nor overwhelmed.

The rest of the evening I kept following my schedule, staying disciplined and trying not to get distracted. It’s strange how much comfort I find in routine, but it definitely helps keep my anxiety down and my mind clear. I’m glad I can rely on that, especially during busy days.

Now, as I prepare to head home to sleep, I feel a quiet sense of accomplishment. I stuck to my plan and handled the unexpected blockages calmly. I’m curious about what tomorrow might bring—hopefully fewer blocked paths and maybe, if I’m lucky, a chance to explore a little off schedule, even though that feels a bit scary. But for now, I’m content to rest and recharge.

Here’s to another day of small but steady progress.
