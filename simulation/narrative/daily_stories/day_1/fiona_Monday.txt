Dear Diary,

Well, it was another typical Monday, sticking to the good olâ€™ routine. I started my day having a slow morning at home, it was a little more repetitive than usual, but that's just how I like it. The familiarity of home is comforting for an introvert like me. 

I decided to have a late breakfast at the downtown cafe. I love the buzz of the place, just enough to be interesting but not too much to be overwhelming. They really do make the best scrambled eggs on toast. After breakfast, I went to the office. Minimal work was on the agenda today, so I got to take it easy and not stress too much. 

I had my coffee break back at the downtown cafe. It was a nice way to break up the work day. Their coffee is just the right level of strong and the aroma always makes me feel at ease. I finished my work back at the office. It was a smooth sailing kind of day with no major hiccups. 

After work, I went to the central park to socialize a bit. It's not really my thing, but I do try to push myself out of my comfort zone sometimes. I ended up having a conversation with Alex Rodriguez. It was nice, not too taxing, just the right amount of social interaction for me.

Then, it was time to head home. After such a long day, my bed was a welcome sight. I cannot emphasize enough how much I love my sleep. Tomorrow will probably be much like today, but who knows? I might switch up my routine, being spontaneous and all. 

Goodnight,

Fiona
