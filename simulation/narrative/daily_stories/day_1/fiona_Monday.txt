Monday, well, here we are again.

Honestly, today wasn’t that thrilling, but I guess it went as expected. I pretty much stuck to my schedule, which is kinda rare for me since I can be so lazy and spontaneous at times. But today, I was all about following the plan — nothing too wild.

I started the morning slow, just hanging around at home, enjoying that quiet, lazy vibe. I’m definitely not a morning person, so having a slow morning felt good, no rush at all. I did think about maybe skipping the late breakfast at the downtown cafe, but nah, I figured I’d follow through. Plus, the cafe is nice, and it’s a little change of scenery from my usual four walls.

Breakfast was chill — nothing fancy, just what I needed to wake up a bit more without feeling overwhelmed. I didn’t feel like making small talk or being too social, so I kept to myself mostly, just watching people bustle around downtown as usual. Thought about maybe chatting with someone, but that felt like too much effort, even though I can be spontaneous sometimes. Go figure.

After that, I headed to the business office for what my schedule calls “minimal work.” And that’s exactly what I did — minimal. I probably looked like I was just sitting there pretending to work, but hey, I got the important stuff done without overdoing it. The office vibe is always a bit draining, especially when you’re more of an introvert like me, so I was glad to keep it light.

Mid-afternoon brought a coffee break back at the cafe, which was a nice little pause. I didn’t really talk much, just enjoyed my coffee and watched the world go by. Honestly, sometimes I like those quiet moments more than actual work or socializing.

Towards the end of the day, I went back to the office to wrap up whatever needed finishing. Again, no surprises — just quietly ticking things off my list. I didn’t try to stand out or anything, which suits me perfectly.

Then came the time to socialize at the park. My path to central park was blocked, which was a bit annoying, but I found a new spot. I ended up talking to Ethan Brooks a couple of times. He’s easy to chat with, which is lucky because I’m not usually great at starting conversations or pushing myself to be social. The chats were nice — casual, no pressure, just enough to feel connected without going overboard.

After that, I decided it was time to call it a day and head back home. Ethan seemed busy, so I didn’t want to interrupt whatever he was up to. Back at home now, and it feels good to just chill and get some rest. Sleep at home is exactly what I need after a day of mostly sticking to the schedule and pushing through.

Reflecting on today, I’m actually kind of proud I managed to follow my schedule so strictly. Usually, I’d bail on some parts or get distracted, but today I kept it together. I still felt a bit drained from all the minimal work and brief socializing, but that’s how it goes when you’re not naturally outgoing.

Tomorrow, I think I’ll try to keep this balance — not too much effort, but enough to keep things moving. Maybe I’ll even surprise myself and be a bit more spontaneous, who knows? For now, though, I’m ready to just relax and maybe daydream a bit before sleep.

Alright, that’s it for today. Time to switch off and recharge.
