Wednesday, [Date]

Today was pretty much a day of sticking strictly to my schedule, which I think I needed. I woke up and had breakfast at the student accommodation as usual. Nothing special about the meal, but it was nice to sit quietly and eat before heading out. The morning classes at college went as expected. I was definitely ready to learn, and I managed to keep my focus pretty well. It’s always a bit of a challenge to keep my attention on everything, but I’m trying to be more conscientious about it. I don’t want to fall behind, especially with all the material piling up.

When lunchtime came around, I planned to go to the downtown cafe, but my usual path was blocked somehow. Nothing major, but it made me have to find a new spot. I ended up eating somewhere a bit quieter, which was fine by me. I actually prefer less noisy places, so it wasn’t really an inconvenience. It gave me a chance to be a little curious about a new place around town, even if just for a moment.

Afternoon classes were back at the college campus. Again, my path was blocked at first, but I found another way without too much trouble. The classes were pretty packed with stuff, and I really had to concentrate. I’ve been feeling a bit behind lately, so I put in extra effort to catch up. It’s exhausting, but I know it’s worth it. I always feel a bit more confident when I’m caught up with my studies.

Dinner was supposed to be at the student accommodation, and again, the usual path was blocked, but I figured out another way to get there. It’s frustrating sometimes, but I try not to get annoyed by these minor obstacles. I guess being conscientious means accepting little inconveniences as part of the process.

Later in the evening, I went to the park to socialize a bit. That part is always a bit awkward for me since I’m more of an introvert. But today, a few people came over to talk – Fiona Walsh, Alex Rodriguez, and Diana Kim. The conversations were nice and not too overwhelming. I didn’t interrupt when they seemed busy, which felt respectful. I’m glad I pushed myself to engage a little; it’s good to connect even if it’s small talk.

After that, I decided it was time to head home. I really needed some quiet and sleep. Following my schedule meant lots of traveling back and forth today, but I stuck to it and felt productive. Sometimes it’s tough to balance being social and keeping up with everything else, but today felt manageable.

Reflection for tomorrow: I want to keep following my schedule, but maybe I’ll try to be a bit more flexible when obstacles come up. It’s good to have structure, but I don’t want to get too rigid. Also, maybe I can find a little more balance between studying and socializing. I feel like I’m making progress, but there’s always room to improve.

Time to rest now. Hopefully, tomorrow will be smooth and maybe a little less blocked paths.
