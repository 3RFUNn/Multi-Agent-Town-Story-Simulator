Wednesday, June 12

Well, today was pretty much what I expected — following my usual schedule without any major surprises. I guess I can’t deny I’m a creature of habit. Woke up slow at home, as always. Took my time dragging myself out of bed and just hanging around the apartment for a bit. No rush, no pressure. That’s really the best way I work, especially since I’m not exactly an early riser or a go-getter. I’m more of the “take it as it comes” type, which is probably why following a schedule makes my life feel a bit less chaotic.

Late breakfast at the downtown cafe was nice, as usual. It’s a cozy spot, and I like sitting there with a cup of coffee, people-watching, but not engaging too much. I’m definitely more comfortable keeping to myself in public places, and it’s perfect having that little routine. The food was decent, nothing special, but it hit the spot. I felt pretty chill, even if I was mostly observing rather than interacting.

Then it was off to the business office for what I call “minimal work.” Honestly, it’s kind of the highlight of my day in a weird way. Not because I love working (far from it), but because it gives me a legitimate reason to be somewhere other than home or the cafe. Plus, I get to check off some tasks without going full throttle, which suits my lazy and introverted self perfectly. I managed to keep my head down, get through everything, and not talk more than necessary. Win-win. 

Coffee break back at the cafe was a nice little pause. Same vibes as breakfast — quiet, low-key, and just enough interaction to feel like I’m part of the world without getting drained by it. I guess I’m lucky to have those spots that feel like a second home without the hassle of being too social.

After finishing work at the office, I was supposed to hit the park to socialize a bit. The path to central park was blocked, which threw me off for a second. I don’t like unexpected detours, but I decided to find a new spot nearby instead. I ended up chatting with Bella Chen for a while, and then later on Charlie Davis. Both were nice conversations, nothing too deep but enough to feel connected. It’s weird because I’m naturally an introvert who likes to avoid too much socializing, but sometimes a little spontaneous chat is kind of refreshing. It’s like dipping my toe in the water without diving in.

Eventually, I called it a day and headed back home. You know me — I’m happiest in my own space, especially after a day that’s been full of moving around and small social interactions. There’s just something comforting about sinking into my bed and knowing I don’t have to go anywhere or do anything else for the rest of the night.

Reflecting on today, I think sticking to my schedule helped me keep things balanced. I didn’t push myself too hard or feel guilty for taking things slow. That’s important because sometimes I get a little restless with my own laziness. Tomorrow, I want to try being a bit more spontaneous, maybe mix up the cafe or park spots, just to shake things up a bit. But no promises — I’m still a lazy introvert at heart, and comfort is a hard habit to break.

Anyway, here’s to a low-key, manageable day tomorrow. Hopefully I’ll surprise myself just a little.
