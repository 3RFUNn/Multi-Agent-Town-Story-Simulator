Thursday, April 25th

Today was one of those days where I really stuck to my schedule—no surprises, no detours, just following through on everything I planned. I guess that’s pretty typical for me, being conscientious and all, but sometimes it feels like I’m moving on autopilot. Still, keeping things organized helps me stay focused, especially with college and everything going on.

The day started early at the student accommodation, where I had breakfast. It was quiet, which I appreciate. I’m not much of a morning person, and I like having some calm time before the busyness of classes hits. After breakfast, I headed straight to the college campus for the morning classes. I was ready to learn and stayed attentive. Sometimes it’s hard to keep up with everything, but I made an effort to really focus today.

When lunchtime rolled around, I planned to go to the downtown cafe, but the path was blocked. I wasn’t too bothered—I just found another spot nearby. It was less crowded and a bit more tucked away, which made me feel comfortable. I ate quietly and took a moment to observe people around me. It’s fascinating to watch how everyone moves and interacts without really noticing me.

After lunch, it was back to the college campus for the afternoon classes. The afternoon was more demanding, and I had to put extra effort into focusing and catching up. I don’t like falling behind, so I made sure to stay on top of my work. It’s stressful sometimes, but I know it’s necessary.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation. Eating there again felt like a routine, but it’s also nice to be in a familiar space where I don’t have to put on any kind of social mask. I appreciate that kind of low-key environment.

In the evening, according to my schedule, it was time to socialize at the park. I’m naturally introverted, so socializing isn’t my favorite thing, but I know it’s important to engage. I met up with Alex Rodriguez and had a nice chat—he’s easy to talk to and doesn’t expect much, which makes me comfortable. Then Charlie Davis came over a few times, and we had several short conversations. I noticed I kept excusing myself after a while, probably because too much interaction drains me. Ethan Brooks also stopped by, and we had a good talk as well. I tried to be present without overextending myself.

By the end of the day, I was ready to head home. I felt a bit tired, but satisfied that I followed my schedule so closely. It’s a relief to have structure, and even though I sometimes wonder if I’m too rigid, it definitely keeps me grounded.

For tomorrow, I want to keep this steadiness but maybe be a little more open to small changes or interruptions. It might help me break out of my comfort zone without feeling overwhelmed. I’m curious to see how that would feel.

All in all, a typical Thursday—full of learning, steady routines, and some social moments that were manageable enough. Time to get some rest and be ready for whatever comes next.
