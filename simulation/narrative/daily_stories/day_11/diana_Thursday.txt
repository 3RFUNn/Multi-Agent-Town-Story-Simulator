Thursday, what a day.

I stuck to my schedule perfectly today, which honestly feels pretty good. I don’t usually get to follow my plan so strictly, but today everything just clicked. Woke up at the student accommodation, had breakfast there, which was simple but enough to fuel me for the morning ahead.

Then, I headed over to college for my morning classes. I had a bit of trouble with my usual path because it was blocked, but I found a detour without much hassle. The classes were intense as usual — I really need to buckle down and focus more if I want to keep up. I kept reminding myself that staying conscientious is key, especially with finals coming up soon. It’s a lot, but I’m determined.

Lunch was supposed to be at the downtown cafe, but guess what? My path there was blocked too! That’s twice today that my usual routes were messed with. Still, I didn’t let it throw me off. Found another way and got my lunch in. It was nice to get a little break and some fresh air downtown, though a bit frustrating.

Afternoon classes were back at college. I focused hard, sat down and really tried to catch up on the stuff I’ve been falling behind on. It’s not always easy balancing everything, but I’m proud of my effort today. No distractions, just me and my notes. Felt productive, which always gives me a little boost.

After classes, I went back to the student accommodation for dinner. Same routine, but that’s okay — having a reliable place to eat and relax helps me recharge.

Then came a bit of social time, which I really needed. I headed to Central Park to meet some friends and unwind a bit. The path was blocked multiple times, making me feel like the universe wanted to test my patience today! But eventually, I connected with Alex Rodriguez, and we had a nice chat. It was refreshing to talk about things outside of school — just regular stuff, catching up, sharing a laugh. I also caught up briefly with Fiona Walsh and Charlie Davis earlier in the park. Socializing feels like a good balance to all the study pressure.

Finally, I came home. Time to sleep at home feels right after a full day like this. I’m tired but satisfied — I followed my schedule, stayed disciplined, and still made time for some human connection. All in all, a solid Thursday.

Looking ahead to tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going. Stick to my schedule, but maybe leave a little more wiggle room for unexpected stuff (and blocked paths!). Also, I want to squeeze in a good workout in the morning — gotta keep up my fitness routine to keep my mind sharp. Tomorrow’s another day to make progress, and I’m ready for it.
