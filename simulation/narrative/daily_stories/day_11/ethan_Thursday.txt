Thursday, June 6th

Today was one of those days where sticking to my schedule felt like the main accomplishment. I woke up early, ready to hit the gym for my morning workout, but quickly realized my budget was tighter than I thought—I only had about five bucks to spare, nowhere near enough for a protein breakfast at the cafe or even a gym session fee. It’s frustrating, especially since I’m all about keeping my fitness game strong, but I had to accept it and adjust accordingly.

I ended up heading to the downtown cafe later for a meal since I was really hungry, but again, I had to be mindful of my funds. I couldn’t afford the protein-packed breakfast I usually go for, so I just went with something more budget-friendly that still hit the spot. It helped get me through the morning and into the office where I spent most of the day grinding away at my work tasks. I’m pretty conscientious about staying productive, and today was no exception—I was focused and knocked out everything on my to-do list.

Lunch was another visit to the cafe for something healthy, sticking with what I could afford and keeping my nutrition in check as best as possible. After lunch, it was back to the business office to finish up the afternoon. My energy was steady but I could definitely feel the toll of the tight budget slowing me down a bit, especially when I thought about training at the gym in the evening.

When evening came around, I planned to hit the gym again, but again, the money just wasn’t there. I only had about seven bucks left, which wasn’t enough to cover the training session. I guess that’s just how it is sometimes. Instead of stressing over it, I stuck to my plan of heading home, having dinner there, and focusing on rest instead.

Socializing was part of my schedule today too, so I made my way to central park. My usual route got blocked, so I had to find a different spot to meet people. Bella Chen came over to talk, and we had a nice little chat—just catching up and sharing how things have been. Later, I bumped into Fiona Walsh as well, and we had another good conversation. I really enjoy these moments; being an extrovert, social interaction recharges me in a way that nothing else can.

By the time I got home, I was feeling pretty tired. I made dinner, kept it simple and healthy, and then started winding down for the night. There’s something comforting about finally being home and ready to sleep after a full day of work, socializing, and trying to keep my fitness on track, even when the budget’s tight.

Reflecting on today, I’m proud that I stuck to my schedule and kept moving forward, even when things didn’t go perfectly. I’m learning to be flexible and make the most of what I have, which is a good skill for both fitness and life. Tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum—maybe find some free or low-cost workout options, get a good night’s rest, and keep connecting with friends. Staying consistent is key, and even if it’s not always easy, I’m determined to make it work.

Here’s to a better, stronger day tomorrow.
