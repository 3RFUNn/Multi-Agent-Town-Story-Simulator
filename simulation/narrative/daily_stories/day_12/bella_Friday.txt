Friday, [date]

Today was a pretty typical day, following my schedule almost exactly as planned. I’m glad I stuck to it because it gave me a sense of order and control, which always feels good.

The morning started at the student accommodation with breakfast — nothing fancy, but enough to get me going. Then I headed to college for my morning classes. There was a bit of an obstacle on the way; my usual path to the college campus was blocked, so I had to find a new route. It was a mild annoyance, but I didn’t let it bother me too much. I’m used to having to adapt quietly to things like that.

Classes went well. I was focused and attentive. I really want to catch up on everything because I’ve been feeling a little behind lately. The afternoon classes were the same story — concentration and no distractions. There was another blocked path when I tried to go to downtown cafe for lunch, so again, I had to find another way. I didn’t mind the detour, but it did slow me down a bit. Lunch itself was okay, just a quick bite at the cafe. Nothing special, but enough to recharge.

After lunch, back to college for more classes. I kept reminding myself to really focus and get caught up. It’s not easy, but I know it’s necessary. I’m a little proud of myself for pushing through even when I felt a bit drained.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation, simple and familiar. I like that part of the day — it feels comfortable to be in a place that’s my own space. After dinner, it was time to socialize at Central Park, per the schedule. I started conversations with a few people — Diana Kim, Ethan Brooks, and a few others. I’m glad I made the effort, even though socializing isn’t something that comes naturally to me. With Diana and Ethan, the conversations were pleasant but not too deep, which suits me fine. I noticed that sometimes I catch myself hesitating to interrupt or dive too deep, probably because I’m more introverted and careful about overstepping.

Charlie Davis came by several times, and we had a few nice chats throughout the evening. I think the repeated conversations helped me feel more comfortable, even though I mostly stayed quiet and just listened. I’m realizing that socializing in small doses like this feels manageable, and I appreciate those moments of connection, even if they’re brief.

Eventually, I decided it was time to head home. The walk back was calm and gave me time to think. Being home always helps me reset. I’m ready to sleep now and recharge for tomorrow.

Looking back, I’m glad I stayed consistent with my schedule today. It gave me structure, which I need to stay balanced. I also pushed myself a bit socially, which is something I want to keep working on, but I’m okay with taking it slow. Tomorrow, I hope to keep this momentum going with my studies and maybe find a little more comfort in talking with others. Small steps seem best for me.

Time to get some rest.
