Friday, June 7

Today was a pretty textbook day, which honestly felt good. I stuck to my schedule religiously from start to finish—no slipping up or last-minute changes. There's something reassuring about following a plan, especially on a Friday when things could easily go sideways with the weekend just around the corner.

I started the morning at the student accommodation, grabbed breakfast there, and made sure to fuel up properly. I’m really trying to keep my energy steady with the right balance of carbs and protein. After breakfast, it was time for morning classes at college. I arrived ready to learn and focused throughout the entire morning. The professors were engaging, and I felt good about absorbing the material. There was a bit of a hassle getting around as my path to downtown cafe was blocked when I was supposed to go for lunch, so I had to find an alternate spot. It threw me off a little, but I stayed patient and found a nice quiet cafe nearby. The change actually gave me a chance to slow down and enjoy my meal without rushing.

Afternoon classes were back at the college campus. This part of the day was a bit more demanding, as I had to really buckle down and focus on catching up with my studies. There were moments when I got distracted, but I reminded myself why I’m here and pushed through. I really want to keep my grades solid, so staying disciplined is key. On the way back to the student accommodation for dinner, there was another blockage on my path, which was a bit frustrating, but I managed to find an alternate route without too much trouble.

Dinner was at the accommodation, where I made sure to eat something balanced and healthy. I’ve been careful not to let my diet slip, especially on busy days like today, because I know it affects how I feel both physically and mentally.

After dinner, I headed over to Central Park to socialize a bit. I chatted with Fiona Walsh for a while, which was nice. It’s always good to catch up with friends, especially after a day packed with classes and studying. Before that, Bella Chen stopped by for a quick chat, which was pleasant and light-hearted. These small interactions really help me unwind and remind me there’s more to life than just schoolwork.

Eventually, I made my way home. It’s always such a relief to be back in my own space, ready to relax and prepare for sleep. I followed my usual nighttime routine, making sure I wind down properly so I can get a good night’s rest. It’s important for my fitness and overall well-being.

Looking back, today was a solid example of how sticking to my schedule keeps me grounded and productive. I’m feeling accomplished but not overwhelmed, which is exactly what I need as the week wraps up.

For tomorrow, I want to keep this rhythm going but maybe add in a workout session in the morning. I’ve been neglecting my usual fitness routine a bit with all the studying, and I know getting that endorphin boost will help me stay sharp and motivated. Plus, I’m looking forward to a little more time with friends over the weekend.

All in all, a good day. Ready to recharge and tackle whatever comes next.
