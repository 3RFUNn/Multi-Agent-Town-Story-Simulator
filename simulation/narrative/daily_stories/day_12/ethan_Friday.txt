Man, today was one of those days where I just stuck to the plan no matter what — definitely some ups and downs, but overall I kept my schedule tight. Starting off this morning, I realized my budget was tighter than usual. Only had about $2.50 to spare, which meant no gym workout or protein-packed breakfast at the café like I usually do to fuel up. Kinda frustrating because fitness is a big part of my life, but gotta be realistic. So, I skipped the morning gym session and protein breakfast. Instead, I made a mental note to figure out some free or low-cost workout options — maybe some bodyweight stuff at home or a run around the neighborhood to keep my fitness up without breaking the bank.

Work was the usual grind. I headed to the business office right on time, focused on my tasks, and pushed through. It felt productive, but my energy was a bit low, probably because I didn’t fuel up properly in the morning. The lunch break was interesting — I went to the downtown café as scheduled, but again, the budget limited what I could get. I couldn’t afford the healthy lunch I usually prefer there, so I made do with a cheaper option. Not ideal, but it did the job. Gotta watch these expenses carefully and maybe prep more meals at home to save some money going forward.

After lunch, back to the office for more work. Definitely kept my head down and stayed productive. I like keeping that work rhythm going, it helps me feel accomplished. Later on, I made it to the gym for evening training, but again, money was tight—only had $9, which wasn’t quite enough for the gym fee. So, I ended up not training there. That was a bummer since I’d been looking forward to pushing myself after work. Instead, I found a spot nearby to rest and recharge a bit, which helped ease the tiredness creeping in.

Then came social time, which was definitely the highlight of the day. I planned to hit up Central Park, but the usual path was blocked, so I had to pivot and find a new spot to hang out. Diana Kim stopped by to chat a few times, and those conversations were really nice — always good to catch up and connect, especially with people who bring positive energy. Later, I also caught up with Charlie Davis and Bella Chen. Both chats were refreshing, and honestly, socializing is a big part of what keeps me energized and motivated. It’s funny how even when the day’s budget feels limiting, the people around me help lift my spirits.

Towards the end of the day, hunger hit hard, so I finally went to the café to grab a proper meal. That meal really hit the spot — good food always helps reset my mood and energy. After dinner, I decided to head home to get some rest. My energy was definitely running low by then, and sleeping at home felt like the best way to recharge for tomorrow.

Reflection-wise, today reminded me how important it is to stick to my schedule but also to adapt when things don’t go as planned — especially financially. I’m a fitness enthusiast, and it’s tough when money’s tight, but I can still find ways to stay active without the gym or fancy meals. Tomorrow, I want to plan a simple, budget-friendly workout and maybe cook some protein-rich meals at home to keep my nutrition on track. Also, I want to make time for more social moments; those really made a difference today.

All in all, it was a good, steady day. Looking forward to making the most of tomorrow, keeping my energy up, and finding balance between staying fit, being productive, and enjoying life in this lively town.
