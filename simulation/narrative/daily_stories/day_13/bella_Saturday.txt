Saturday, April 27

Today was a pretty typical day, at least in terms of me sticking to my schedule. I’m glad I managed to follow it so closely because sometimes I get distracted or just want to veer off, but not today. I woke up at the student accommodation, feeling a bit groggy but mostly ready to start the day. Sleeping in there feels more like home compared to the chaos of the rest of the week.

First on the list was brunch at the downtown cafe. I went there pretty early when it was still calm, which suited me perfectly. I’m not the biggest fan of crowds or small talk, so a quieter cafe is the best place for me to collect my thoughts and enjoy some food. The meal was decent, nothing fancy, but it hit the spot especially after skipping breakfast. Being conscientious about following my schedule means I don’t let myself skip meals or waste time, which is something I’m proud of.

After brunch, I headed to the college campus for a study session. I spent a good chunk of time there focused on my work. These study sessions are sometimes draining, but I always leave them feeling a little more accomplished. I’m curious by nature, so digging into my subjects is something I genuinely enjoy, even if it means being quiet and alone most of the time. I noticed some familiar faces but mostly kept to myself. It’s easier that way.

Then it was supposed to be gym time. I ran into a bit of trouble because my usual path to the fitness gym was blocked. That threw me off for a bit, but I’m glad I didn’t let it stop me. Instead, I found a new route and made it there eventually. The workout was good—nothing too intense, just enough to get my blood pumping and clear my mind. I’m not a social person at the gym, so I pretty much focused on my exercises and stayed in my own world.

After the gym, I planned to get dinner and groceries. This part was frustrating because I realized I only had about $19.40 left, which isn’t much for a proper grocery trip. It kept me a bit anxious since I want to stick to my schedule and keep things organized, but money is tight. I had to be really careful about what I picked, and it felt a bit limiting. Being conscientious means I’m trying to budget better, but today was a reminder that I need to be even more mindful.

Later in the evening, I tried to socialize at the park like I had planned. My path there was blocked a couple of times, which was annoying, but I eventually found my way. I ended up having a few conversations with Diana Kim and Charlie Davis. Normally, I’m not the most outgoing, but these chats were nice and less draining than I expected. It’s always interesting to hear what others are up to without feeling the pressure to say too much. I guess being curious about people helps me engage just enough without getting overwhelmed.

Finally, I made my way back home to sleep. It feels good to be back in my own space at the end of the day. Following my schedule strictly today kept me grounded. Even when things were a bit inconvenient or stressful, like the blocked paths and tight budget, I stuck with the plan and it made the day manageable.

Looking ahead to tomorrow, I want to keep this routine going but maybe find ways to be a bit more flexible when unexpected stuff happens. Also, I definitely need to think more about my budget. I don’t want money stress to mess with my ability to follow my schedule or enjoy my days. Overall, not a bad Saturday.
