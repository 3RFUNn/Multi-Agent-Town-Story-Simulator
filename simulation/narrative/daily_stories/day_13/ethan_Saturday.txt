Saturday, April 27

Today was pretty much a full-on follow-my-schedule kind of day. I stuck to it like glue, which is both a good and a little frustrating thing, honestly.

I started off at home like usual, focusing on meal prepping. Given that my budget’s tight—only about $10.50 to my name—I had to be really careful with what I cooked. No fancy, healthy grocery haul for me this week. I’m getting good at making simple, filling meals that still hit the mark. That’s part of being conscientious, I guess: making sure I take care of myself even when money’s tight.

After meal prep, it was time for my planned outdoor activities at Central Park. There’s something refreshing about being outside, moving around, and just soaking in some daylight. I ran into a couple of familiar faces, like Charlie Davis and later Alex Rodriguez. I’m always down for a good chat, and it felt great to catch up, even if it was brief. Being an extrovert really helps with days like this—socializing just charges me up.

I got pretty hungry during my time at the park, so I swung by the local café for a bite. It was nothing fancy, but it hit the spot perfectly. The little boost helped me keep going with my activities and socializing. Later on, I had a nice few conversations with Diana Kim too. She came over a couple of times, and we had some solid talks. It’s nice when you can have those easy, genuine interactions without feeling like you’re interrupting.

When it was time to head back home for dinner, I kept it simple and healthy again. Sticking to my schedule really helped me stay on track, even though the gym was out of the question today. With only $10.50 in my pocket, I can’t afford an intensive workout or a post-workout meal at a café, so home workouts and meal prep it is for now. Not ideal, but it keeps me moving and eating right without breaking the bank.

Towards the evening, I went back out to the park for a bit more socializing. Being around people really lifts my spirits, and today was no exception. Eventually, though, it was time to call it a day and head home to get some rest.

All in all, it was a good day. I may not have had the energy or the funds for a hardcore gym session or expensive meals, but I made the most of what I had. Sticking to my schedule helped keep things grounded, and the social moments were a definite highlight.

Tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going. Maybe find some creative ways to work out at home or outdoors without spending money. And definitely keep nurturing those social connections—they’re important, especially when life feels a little tight. Time to get some good sleep tonight and tackle whatever comes next.
