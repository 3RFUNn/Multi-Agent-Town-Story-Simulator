Sunday, today.

I stuck pretty strictly to my schedule all day, which felt both comforting and a little tiring. I’m glad I followed through—it’s nice to have some structure—but I also felt a bit stuck in a cycle of routine. Mostly, I went back and forth between my home, the student accommodation, the downtown cafe, the college campus, and the park. 

The morning started quietly enough. I was at the student accommodation, trying to get some rest. I think I needed it, especially with the week coming up. After that, it was time to head to the downtown cafe for brunch, but I discovered pretty quickly that I didn’t have enough money to actually buy anything. I had just $0.90 or $1.40—not enough to cover even the cheapest brunch items. That was frustrating. I sat there for a bit, watching people come and go, enjoying their meals, and reminded myself to be more careful with my budget.

Since eating at the cafe wasn’t an option, I decided to go to the college campus for my study session. The campus was busy, and I did my best to focus on my work. I was definitely hungry, so eventually, I gave in and went back to the cafe to grab a small meal. Thankfully, that hit the spot and made me feel a lot better. I’m grateful for that little break—it’s tough to concentrate when your stomach’s growling.

Exercise was on my schedule too, but I couldn’t afford the gym. Again, just $1.40 in my pocket, which is nowhere near enough for a gym pass. I guess I’ll have to find ways to stay active for free—maybe some jogging or stretching at home. It’s not ideal, but it’s better than nothing.

Later, I went to the park to socialize a bit. I’m naturally quite introverted, so socializing takes effort, but I think it’s important to keep up. Fiona Walsh came over to chat a few times, and that was nice. We had small, pleasant conversations. I usually don’t like interrupting people if they seem busy, so I kept it low-key and didn’t push for anything more. There was also a brief chat with Alex Rodriguez, but it was quick. I prefer these small interactions—they’re manageable and meaningful in their own way.

After the park, I headed home. The rest of the evening was quiet. I spent a lot of time at home just reflecting and preparing myself mentally for the days ahead. Following my schedule so strictly today gave me a sense of control, but it also reminded me of my current limitations, especially financially.

So, overall, it was a practical day, maybe not very exciting, but steady. I’m curious about how I can adjust my schedule to better fit my budget and energy levels. Tomorrow, I want to figure out some low-cost or free activities to keep up my exercise without the gym fees, and maybe plan meals more carefully so I don’t end up hungry or frustrated again.

That’s it for today. Hopefully, tomorrow will be a bit easier and more balanced.
