Sunday was a pretty full day, but I stuck to my schedule like a champ — which, honestly, is kind of a surprise given how spontaneous I usually am! I woke up at home and decided to enjoy a lazy morning. No rush, just lounging around and soaking in the chill vibes. It was nice to just be at my own place and take it easy before the day got moving.

After some downtime, I headed over to the downtown cafe for my brunch shift. It’s always a fun gig—lots of friendly faces, great energy, and the smell of fresh coffee everywhere. I love chatting with customers and the team; it keeps me buzzing. I spent a good chunk of the morning there, serving up food and joking around. The vibe was just right, and I felt energized but not rushed.

Once brunch wrapped up, I made my way to Central Park for some personal time. I needed that mental break and some fresh air. Sitting there, I watched people strolling, kids playing, and dogs doing their thing. It was a nice contrast to the busy cafe. I even got pretty hungry, so I swung back to the cafe for a quick bite. The meal totally hit the spot—sometimes, you don’t realize how much you need it until you actually eat it. Felt way better afterward.

Next up was gym time. I’m usually not the biggest fan of workouts, but today I pushed through and got a solid session in. I guess the earlier energy from the cafe and park gave me a boost. Working out always makes me feel good afterward, like I’m taking care of myself, even if it’s a bit of a grind sometimes.

Dinner was a blast—met up with some friends back at the downtown cafe. Nothing beats good food with great company. We laughed a lot, caught up on random things, and just enjoyed the night. I’m definitely a social butterfly, so evenings like this really fuel me. After dinner, I headed back to the park to socialize more. Ran into Alex Rodriguez again—seems like we keep bumping into each other! We had a few good chats; always nice to catch up and just talk about life or whatever comes up. Fiona Walsh also stopped by for a quick hello, which was cool. Talking to people at the park is one of my favorite ways to end the day.

Finally, it was time to head home. I’m back now, tired but satisfied. There’s something comforting about being home after a day full of activity and socializing. I followed my schedule all day, and honestly, it felt good to have that structure while still getting to hang out and do my thing.

For tomorrow, I’m thinking I want to keep the balance of planned activities and spontaneous moments. Maybe mix in a bit more adventure or try something new while still keeping some chill time. It’s all about keeping the energy flowing without burning out. Looking forward to whatever comes next!
