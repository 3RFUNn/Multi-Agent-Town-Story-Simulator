Sunday, today was a bit of a rollercoaster, but I stuck to my schedule as always. I started off the day at the student accommodation, planning to sleep in a bit and get some rest. I really needed that downtime because the week has been pretty hectic. After waking up, I was supposed to head to downtown cafe for brunch, but I quickly realized I didn't have enough money to really enjoy a proper brunch there. I only had about $3.70 left, which isn't enough for much at the cafe, unfortunately.

It was a bit frustrating because I wanted to treat myself, especially after a busy week, but I reminded myself to stay on track and not get discouraged. Instead of splurging, I decided to stick with my schedule and made my way to the college campus for the study session. The study time was productive, although my stomach was rumbling quite a bit. Eventually, I gave in and grabbed a meal at the campus cafe — that actually hit the spot and made me feel a lot better. I guess sometimes you’ve got to balance being frugal with taking care of yourself.

I really wanted to get a workout in today since staying active is super important to me, but the gym was out of reach with my budget. Honestly, it was a bit of a bummer not to exercise the way I like, but I managed some bodyweight exercises back at the accommodation later. I’m trying to be conscientious and make the best of what I have. It’s tough sometimes, but I’m not giving up on my fitness goals.

Later in the day, I was supposed to socialize at the park. The path to Central Park was blocked, so I had to find an alternative spot. Luckily, Ethan Brooks came over and we ended up having a really nice chat. It was good to catch up with him and just talk about random things. Socializing always helps me reset mentally, even if I’m low on energy sometimes.

After that, I decided it was time to head home and get some proper rest. I’ve been going back and forth between the student accommodation and home today, but being back at home feels comforting. I’m ready to sleep and recharge for the week ahead.

Looking back, today wasn’t perfect — money’s tight, and I couldn’t do everything I wanted, but I’m proud that I stayed consistent with my schedule. That’s a win. Tomorrow, I want to focus on budgeting better so I can afford some healthier food options and maybe squeeze in a gym session. I also want to find more creative ways to stay active without spending money. I know it’s possible if I keep at it. Here’s to making progress, no matter how small.

Alright, time to get some sleep now. Tomorrow’s a new day!
