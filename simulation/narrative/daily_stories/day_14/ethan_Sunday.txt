Sunday, what a day. I stuck to my schedule like glue, which feels good — that conscientious side of me definitely appreciates the structure. Woke up at home, as usual, no surprises there. I’ve been trying to keep up with my fitness routine, but man, the budget’s tight. I only had about $10.50 to spare, which meant no intensive gym sessions or fancy post-workout meals at cafes today. It’s frustrating since I love hitting the gym hard and fueling up properly afterward, but I had to get creative.

So, I decided to meal prep at home multiple times throughout the day. It’s not the most exciting, but it’s practical and fits my current means. I focused on making healthy, simple meals that would keep me fueled without breaking the bank. It’s a bit of a balancing act — wanting to eat well and train hard but needing to be financially responsible. I’m proud of myself for sticking to it, though. Keeping the fitness mindset alive even when the resources aren’t ideal is part of the challenge.

Later, I headed to Central Park for some outdoor activities. That fresh air and open space always do wonders for clearing my head and keeping me physically active without any cost. I was really hungry by the time I got there, so I indulged in a quick meal at a cafe nearby. Nothing fancy, but it hit the spot and recharged me to keep moving. Feels nice to reflect on how important these moments are — even small breaks and simple meals can make a difference.

Socializing was also on the agenda, and I managed to catch up with Diana Kim at the park. We had a couple of good chats, nothing too deep but just enough to feel connected. It’s funny how these little interactions, even brief ones, can brighten up a day. Being an extrovert, I thrive on that — I’m always energized after talking things through with people, sharing a laugh, or just catching up. Diana’s great company, and it was nice to have that social boost.

After the park and talking with Diana, I headed back home. Followed through with my healthy dinner plan, sticking to what I had prepped. It felt good to end the day on a responsible note — fueling my body properly, even when it’s a bit modest.

Overall, I’d say today was a solid mix of discipline, adaptability, and social connection. I’m learning to make the most of what I have — being a fitness enthusiast on a budget is definitely a test of creativity and willpower. But honestly, I’m okay with it. This town, my routine, the people I bump into, they all keep me grounded.

For tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going. Maybe I’ll explore some more free or low-cost ways to stay active — maybe jogging routes, bodyweight workouts, or even joining a community sports group if I can find one. And I’ll definitely try to reach out to a few more friends or neighbors; social energy is just as important as physical energy for me. Here’s to keeping the balance and pushing forward without losing sight of the small wins.
