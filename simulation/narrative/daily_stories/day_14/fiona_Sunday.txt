Sunday, huh. Another one of those days where I mostly just stuck to the schedule — which is kind of the whole point of having one, right? I didn’t really stray much from home or what was planned, but I guess that’s what Sundays are for, especially for someone like me who’s more on the lazy and introverted side.

Woke up late, as usual. I mean, sleeping in is kind of a must on a Sunday. I stayed home for a good chunk of the morning, just lounging around, half-watching some TV, scrolling on my phone, not really feeling like moving much. Felt pretty chill, honestly. No stress, no big plans that I had to worry about. I know some people get antsy if they don’t do something productive, but not me. Laziness suits me just fine.

Eventually, the schedule nudged me to head out to brunch at that downtown cafe I like. It’s a nice little spot, not too loud, and the food is decent without demanding a ton of effort. I went there, grabbed a decent meal, and honestly, it was exactly what I needed. That meal hit the spot and made me feel a lot better. I was pretty hungry by then, and eating out felt like a little treat despite my tight budget.

After brunch, the schedule called for a lazy afternoon at the central park, so I slowly made my way over there. The park was pretty calm, which I liked. I found a quiet spot to just lounge, maybe people-watch a little, and let the afternoon drift by. It was nice to just be outside without any pressure to be “on.” I ran into Bella Chen a few times, and we ended up chatting here and there. She’s nice company, and even though I’m not the most social person, those little conversations were kind of refreshing. Not too overwhelming, just enough to feel connected without draining me.

Later on, when it was time to head home, I ran into a bit of a snag with dinner plans. According to the schedule, I was supposed to get takeout, but my budget was tight — like really tight — I only had about $3.50 left, which is nowhere near enough for takeout. I kept thinking about it for a while, went back and forth, but in the end, hunger won out. I just went back to the cafe and got a small meal there. It wasn’t fancy, but it was filling, and honestly, sometimes you just need to eat without overthinking it.

Towards the evening, there were more social moments at the park; I talked with a few people — Alex Rodriguez, Charlie Davis, and again Bella. It was surprising how those little bursts of socializing didn’t completely exhaust me. Maybe because I spaced them out and kept things casual. Still, after a couple of chats, I was ready to call it a day.

The rest of the evening was spent back at home where I just relaxed and prepared to sleep. I keep deciding to follow my schedule strictly, which might sound boring, but for me, it gives a bit of structure without forcing me to do too much. I guess being spontaneous in small doses, like when I decided to eat at the cafe despite the budget, keeps things interesting enough.

All in all, today was a solid lazy Sunday. Nothing wild, nothing stressful, just a good balance of chilling, some social time sprinkled in, and managing to get by on a tight budget without too much hassle. I’m glad I stuck to my schedule, but I also realized I’m okay with bending it a little when needed. Tomorrow, I think I’ll try to keep this balance going — maybe push myself a tiny bit more to try something new, but nothing crazy. For now, I’m just glad to get some rest.
