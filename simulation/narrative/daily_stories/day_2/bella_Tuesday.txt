Tuesday, [Date]

Today pretty much went as planned, which honestly felt kind of comforting. I stuck closely to my schedule from start to finish — it’s not always exciting, but I think it helps me keep my head clear and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

The morning started off at the student accommodation where I had breakfast. It’s always a bit quiet in the morning, which suits me just fine. I like the calm before the day really kicks in. After that, I headed straight over to the college campus for my morning classes. I was ready to learn and focused on the material. Sometimes it’s hard to stay engaged for long stretches, but I reminded myself to keep up with everything so I don’t fall behind.

Lunchtime was supposed to be at the downtown cafe, but when I got there, the path was blocked. That threw me off a little because I don’t like unexpected changes, but I found another place nearby to eat. It was a small spot I hadn’t tried before. Being curious, I paid attention to the details of the place — the decor, the menu, the people passing by. It was a nice little break in the routine.

In the afternoon, I returned to campus for more classes. I really needed to focus and catch up on some things I’d been procrastinating on. It was a bit stressful at times, but I managed to get through it. I felt a sense of accomplishment afterward, even if it wasn’t the most exciting part of the day.

After classes, I went back to the student accommodation for dinner. It was quiet again, mostly just me and a few others. I like eating there better than somewhere noisy or crowded. It feels more comfortable, like a little safe bubble.

Later in the evening, it was time to socialize at the park. I don’t usually seek out social situations, but I know it’s important, so I followed my schedule even though part of me wanted to just stay in. Charlie Davis came over, and we had a nice chat. It was relaxed, nothing too deep, but friendly. Then Diana Kim stopped by twice, and we talked both times. She’s easy to talk to, and I appreciated the company. After the last conversation, I felt more at ease than I expected. Socializing can be draining, but these brief interactions reminded me it doesn’t have to be overwhelming if I keep it manageable.

Once everything wrapped up, I decided it was time to head home to sleep. I arrived without any fuss and felt ready to rest. Following my schedule so closely today made the day feel predictable but also productive, which is exactly what I needed.

Reflecting on all this, I think my approach of sticking to the plan really helps keep my anxiety in check. Tomorrow, I want to try to stay just as disciplined but maybe allow myself a little more flexibility — maybe explore a new route or try a different lunch spot intentionally. It could be a good way to balance my conscientious nature with a bit of curiosity and spontaneous discovery.

For now, though, I’m just glad to be home and ready to sleep. Tomorrow is another day to keep learning and growing, one step at a time.
