Tuesday felt like one of those days where sticking to the plan really paid off. I was laser-focused on following my schedule, and it honestly gave me a sense of calm and control throughout the day.

The morning started at the student accommodation with a quick breakfast—I kept it light but nutritious, which is always a priority for me. Fueling my body right is key, especially on days packed with classes. After breakfast, I headed straight to the college campus for my morning classes. I was ready and eager to learn, probably because I made sure to get a good night’s sleep at home last night. The lectures were engaging, and I made sure to take detailed notes so I wouldn’t have to cram later. It feels good to be conscientious about my studies, knowing that all the small efforts add up.

Lunch was at the downtown cafe, which was a nice break from the usual routine. I picked something healthy but satisfying—salad with grilled chicken and a side of quinoa. I even squeezed in a short walk around the block after eating to keep my energy up and clear my mind before heading back to college for afternoon classes. I’m really trying to stay active, even on busy days, so little walks like that make a difference.

Afternoon classes were a bit more intense, and I found myself needing to focus hard to keep up. There were a few moments when I felt a bit overwhelmed with everything going on, but I reminded myself to stick to the schedule, take it one task at a time, and trust the process. I spent a solid chunk of time reviewing difficult material and making sure I understand key concepts. I’m usually pretty disciplined about this, but I can tell the effort is paying off, even if it’s exhausting.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation. For a while, I had trouble getting there because my usual path was blocked, but I figured out a new route without too much trouble. I had a simple but nourishing meal—roasted veggies with brown rice and a little bit of tofu. I’ve been really mindful about balancing my meals lately, which helps me keep my energy consistent and avoid any sluggishness.

After dinner, I headed to Central Park to socialize a bit and unwind. It was great to catch up with Ethan Brooks and Bella Chen. We had some really nice conversations, nothing too heavy, just the kind of easy chats that make you feel connected to the community here. I enjoy those moments because they remind me that even with a busy schedule, taking time to connect with friends is important for mental health. Bella actually came over twice, and we ended up having a really nice, relaxed chat before I decided it was time to head home.

Once home, I was ready to wind down and get some rest. I’m proud of how consistent I was today—every time I arrived at home, I reminded myself it was time to sleep and recharge. It feels good to honor that, especially on a Tuesday, which can sometimes drag when you’re juggling so much.

Looking ahead to tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum. I’m going to stick with my schedule but also try to carve out a bit more time for stretches or light exercise in the morning. It helps me start the day focused and energized. Also, maybe I’ll plan some small breaks during study sessions so I don’t get too drained. Overall, today was productive and balanced, and I’m grateful for that. Here’s to keeping it up!
