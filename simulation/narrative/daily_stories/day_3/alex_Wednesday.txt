Wednesday, what a day. Stuck pretty tightly to my schedule from morning to night, which honestly felt both good and a bit draining. I’m that kind of person who thrives on routine but also loves to mix it up with people and activities, so today was a bit of a balancing act.

Started off as usual, meaning I headed to the downtown cafe for my morning coffee ritual. Except, surprise surprise, I only had two bucks on me, which wasn’t enough to cover the coffee. Not the best way to start the day, but hey, it happens. I figured I’d just power through and get to the office to focus on work instead. Honestly, caffeine would’ve helped, but I kept my energy up by just diving right in.

Work was its usual grind. I’ve been a total workaholic lately—lots of tasks to knock out, and I stayed locked in all morning and afternoon. The office felt a bit like my second home today. I’m proud of how productive I was, though I’ll admit it’s easy to get tunnel vision and forget to breathe sometimes. Lunch was interesting. I tried to hit the downtown cafe again for a break, but the path was blocked, so I had to find a new spot. Ended up back at the same cafe anyway once the path cleared. It was nice to sit down for a bit, recharge, and soak in some of the town’s energy.

Evening rolled around, and I made it to the gym for my workout. That was a highlight. Nothing beats breaking a sweat after a full day of sitting and thinking. It’s my way to unwind and clear my head. After the gym, I went back to the cafe for dinner. Again, budget was tight—I only had $12.50, so I couldn’t really splurge. Made do, though. It’s tough sometimes balancing social habits and hobbies with the wallet, but following my schedule means sticking to what’s feasible.

Later, I headed to Central Park to socialize a bit, which is crucial for me because I’m definitely a social butterfly. I had some really good chats with Diana Kim and Ethan Brooks. Both stopped by to talk, and I enjoyed catching up with them. Those moments remind me why this town feels like home — it’s the people, the familiar faces, the little conversations that keep life vibrant. Even though I’m a workaholic, these social breaks are what keep me grounded.

Nightlife was on my schedule but, surprise, surprise again, I couldn’t afford to hit the bar. Same $12.50 limit. It’s frustrating sometimes wanting to jump into the nightlife buzz but knowing the budget just won’t allow it. I stuck to my plan though, heading home instead, ready to call it a night and get some rest.

Reflecting on today, it was a solid day of sticking to the plan, being productive, and connecting with friends despite some financial tightness. I can feel the grind wearing on me a bit, but I also know that tomorrow’s another chance to balance work, social life, and self-care. I want to be a bit more flexible with my schedule maybe, leave room for some spontaneous fun without stressing the budget too much. For now, time to sleep and reset. Ready to tackle whatever Wednesday brings next week.
