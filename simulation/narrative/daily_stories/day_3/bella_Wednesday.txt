Wednesday,  

Today was pretty much a day of sticking to the plan, which honestly felt both reassuring and a little monotonous. I woke up early at the student accommodation, had breakfast there as usual. Nothing fancy, but it did the job. I’m glad I followed my schedule — it keeps the day from feeling too chaotic, especially since I’m still getting used to balancing classes and everything else.

Morning classes at college went about as expected. I was ready, took notes diligently, and tried to stay focused. The lectures are sometimes overwhelming, but I’m curious enough to want to understand everything properly. I noticed a few familiar faces but mostly kept to myself — I’m not really one to start conversations unless I have a reason. The campus felt calm this morning, which helped me settle into the study mode.

Lunch was supposed to be at the downtown cafe, but the way was blocked for some reason. I had to find a new spot, which threw me off a bit, but I managed. It was a small detour, and I stayed focused on following my schedule instead of letting frustration get the better of me. I appreciate that about myself — being conscientious helps in moments like these.

Afternoon classes were back at the college campus. Again, I concentrated on catching up with my studies. There was a lot to take in, and I felt the pressure to keep up with everything. But I reminded myself that being consistent is more important than rushing. I think that mindset helped me stay grounded rather than getting anxious.

Dinner was back at the accommodation, and after eating, I went to the park for some socializing, which is unusual for me. Fiona Walsh came over to talk, and we had a nice chat. I don’t usually seek out social interactions, but it was pleasant and not too overwhelming. It felt good to connect a little without too much noise or pressure. I’m glad she came by — it made the evening feel less isolated.

Later on, I noticed some people seemed busy, so I decided not to interrupt, which felt right. I’m still more comfortable observing than jumping into conversations. Eventually, I headed home to sleep — following my schedule strictly as always. It’s comforting to have that structure, even if it sometimes feels repetitive.

Looking back, today was a mix of quiet determination and small social moments. I’m proud of sticking to my schedule and handling the unexpected blocks calmly. It’s not always easy, especially when I want to retreat into my own space, but I’m trying to balance that with being open to little interactions.

For tomorrow, I want to keep this balance going — focus on my studies, keep following my schedule, but maybe be a bit more open to brief social moments like today. It’s a slow process, but I’m getting there. For now, time to get some rest and recharge.
