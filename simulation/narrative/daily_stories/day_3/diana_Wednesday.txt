Wednesday, today felt like a pretty solid day of sticking to my routine—maybe even a bit too much, honestly. I woke up at the student accommodation as usual, had breakfast there, and right after, I headed straight to my morning classes on campus. I was feeling focused and ready to absorb everything, which is a good feeling because sometimes I struggle to get into the groove at the start of the day.

The campus was its usual busy self, but I managed to find my rhythm easily. The classes went well, and I was on point with my notes and participation. I like when I can really engage with the material instead of zoning out or just skimming through it. After the morning sessions, I went downtown for lunch at my favorite cafe. It’s always nice to take a little break from campus and get some fresh air, plus the food there is solid and keeps me fueled for the afternoon.

Afternoon classes were a bit more challenging because my usual path to campus was blocked—some construction or event going on, I think. I had to find a detour, but it wasn’t too bad. Once I got back, I really buckled down and focused on catching up on some study material that’s been piling up. I’m pretty conscientious when it comes to my studies, so even when things get busy or a little frustrating, I try to keep on top of it rather than procrastinate.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation, but again, my usual way there was blocked. I don’t mind detours, though—it’s a little reminder that things rarely go exactly as planned. Dinner was simple but satisfying, and I took the time to refuel after a full day of being on the move.

After dinner, I headed to Central Park to socialize a bit. I chatted with Alex Rodriguez for a while, which was nice—he’s always easy to talk to. Then Charlie Davis came over a few times, and we had some good conversations. It’s always refreshing to catch up with friends outside of classes and just enjoy some casual, laid-back moments. I find that socializing helps me recharge in a different way than just working out or studying.

Finally, it was time to head home for the night. I arrived at home feeling pretty tired but satisfied with how the day went. I really stuck to my schedule today, which makes me feel productive and responsible, even if it’s a bit repetitive at times. I guess that’s part of the rhythm of balancing college and personal life.

Looking ahead to tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going but maybe add a little more variety. Maybe I can squeeze in an extra workout or explore a new route to campus so it doesn’t feel so routine all the time. Staying consistent is important to me, especially with fitness and studies, but a bit of fresh energy wouldn’t hurt. Here’s to another good day tomorrow!
