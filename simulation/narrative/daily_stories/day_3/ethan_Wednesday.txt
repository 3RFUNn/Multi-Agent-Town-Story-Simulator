Wednesday, what a day.

Woke up right on schedule, ready to hit the gym for my morning workout. I’m really committed to staying on track, so following my routine is key. But here’s the thing — I realized I only had $8.50 on me. That’s not enough for the gym membership or even a drop-in fee. Kinda bummed since I was pumped to get that sweat session going first thing. I mulled over alternatives, but sticking to the schedule was still my priority, so I had to let that gym plan go for the morning.

Same story when I tried to grab a protein-packed breakfast at the cafe afterward. $8.50 just doesn’t cut it these days, and I had to accept that I couldn’t afford my usual healthy breakfast. Felt frustrating, because nutrition is a big part of my fitness mindset, but I had to get creative and make sure to eat something at home later.

Moved on to work at the office. That part of the day was solid — I managed to focus and checked off a lot of my work tasks. Honestly, work helps keep my mind busy and productive, which is great when other parts of my routine have to shift. I was grateful for that stability.

Lunchtime rolled around, and I tried the downtown cafe for a healthy meal. Same issue resurfaced — $8.50 again isn’t enough to cover my usual lunch options. It’s a little disappointing, but I reminded myself that sticking to the schedule means adapting, so I skipped the cafe meal and planned to eat something simpler later.

Back at the office, I stayed focused through the afternoon. I’m proud of how consistent I was with work today, even if my fitness and nutrition plans didn’t go exactly as hoped.

Evening training at the gym was next on the schedule, and this time I managed to get there despite the earlier money hiccup. The workout felt good — definitely needed after a day like this. I guess I found a way to make it work, and that felt like a win. After training, I was pretty wiped, energy definitely dipping — I needed a rest before heading home.

Tried to get to the central park to recharge since it’s usually my go-to spot. Unfortunately, the path was blocked, not once but twice, so I had to find a new quiet place to relax. Thankfully, I found a spot to sit and just breathe for a few minutes. That calm moment really helped ease the tiredness.

While I was resting, I bumped into Alex Rodriguez, and we got into a good conversation. It was nice catching up — felt like a reminder that even in busy or challenging days, connecting with people keeps things balanced.

Eventually, I headed home but my usual route was blocked too. Had to find another way home, but finally made it back safe and sound. Time to sleep at home and recharge fully for tomorrow.

Reflecting on today — I stuck to my schedule no matter what, and that discipline feels solid. Sure, I had to adjust some parts because of money and blocked paths, but I didn’t let it throw me off completely. I’m learning that being conscientious about my routine means also being flexible when life throws curveballs.

Tomorrow, I want to plan ahead a bit more with budgeting to avoid the breakfast and lunch issues today. Also, maybe scout some backup workout options or at-home routines when the gym isn’t accessible or affordable. Bottom line: keep the momentum going while staying realistic about what’s possible. That’s the goal.

Alright, time to get some rest. Big day tomorrow.
