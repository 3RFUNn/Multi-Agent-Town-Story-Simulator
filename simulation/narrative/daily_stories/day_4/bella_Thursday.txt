Thursday, today felt pretty routine, but I guess sometimes that’s okay. I stuck closely to my schedule all day, which was a relief, honestly. It helped keep me focused, especially with all the classes and little social moments.

I started the morning at the student accommodation, having breakfast there. Nothing special, just the usual food, but it gave me some quiet time before heading to morning classes on campus. The campus was busy as always, but I managed to settle in quickly and keep up with the lectures. I’m glad I stuck with it because some topics were a bit tricky, and I needed to pay close attention. It’s a little exhausting to be that focused all morning, but I know it’s necessary.

Lunchtime was a bit frustrating. I planned to go to the downtown café, but the path was blocked for some reason, so I had to find somewhere else to eat. It was a little annoying because I was looking forward to that break, but I found another quiet spot nearby. It wasn’t the same atmosphere, but it worked. I guess being adaptable is part of following a schedule rigidly.

Afternoon classes went smoothly enough. I was really determined to catch up on my studies today because I felt like I’d fallen a little behind last week. It’s strange how even though I’m introverted, I sometimes get overwhelmed by all the material and social interactions packed into a day. But I kept at it, stayed conscientious, and tried not to stress too much.

Dinner was back at the accommodation, which felt like coming home after a long day. It’s nice having that space where I can just relax and not think about anything for a little while.

After dinner, it was time to socialize at the park, according to my schedule. That’s always a bit of a challenge for me since I’m naturally introverted, but I figured I’d try. I started conversations with Alex Rodriguez and then Ethan Brooks. It was actually nice talking to them; Ethan came over twice, and we had some pretty good chats. I didn’t feel too drained, which was a pleasant surprise. Still, I kept things light and didn’t push too hard for deeper conversations – I’m learning to balance my curiosity and social energy better.

Eventually, I decided it was time to head home and get some sleep. I noticed a few people seemed busy, so I chose not to interrupt anything, which felt respectful and comfortable for me. Being conscientious like that makes me feel better about how I interact with others.

Overall, today was about sticking to my plan and making steady progress. I’m proud that I followed my schedule so closely, even when things didn’t go exactly as expected, like with lunch or socializing. It’s reassuring to have a structure, but I’m also learning to be flexible within it.

Tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going. Maybe I’ll try to find a new café for lunch if downtown is still blocked, just to change things up a bit. And I should probably review my notes again before class so I’m even more prepared. Small, manageable steps—that’s what works best for me.
