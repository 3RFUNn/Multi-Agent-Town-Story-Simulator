Thursday, what a full and steady day.

I woke up early at the student accommodation and stuck to my usual routine — breakfast there to fuel up for the day. I’ve really settled into following my schedule closely; it’s keeping me focused and balanced, which feels good. No wandering off plan today, just a solid commitment to what I arranged.

After breakfast, I headed over to college for my morning classes. The campus was pretty lively as usual, but I felt ready and prepared for the lectures. I made sure to pay close attention and take good notes — I’m determined to stay on top of my studies, especially since there are a few subjects where I need to catch up a bit. It’s not always easy juggling everything, but I like having a clear structure.

Lunch was at the downtown cafe, which is one of my favorite spots. I took some time to enjoy the food and soak up the atmosphere. It was a nice little break from being on campus all day. After lunch, I had to find a new route to get back to college — my usual path was blocked for some reason. It was a slight detour, but nothing too stressful. I arrived just in time for my afternoon classes and buckled down to focus. The afternoon went by quickly with back-to-back sessions, and I made sure to really engage this time.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation. I kept it simple and healthy, sticking to the fitness goals I’ve been working on. Eating well really makes a difference in how I feel after a long day. After dinner, I went to Central Park for some social time, which was a nice change of pace. I chatted with Fiona Walsh and then Charlie Davis — both conversations were easy and refreshing. It’s always nice to connect with friends and decompress outside of the academic buzz. Fiona and I talked about weekend plans and some fitness challenges we want to try together, which got me a bit excited.

Finally, I headed home to get some rest. I’m feeling pretty good about how the day went. Following my schedule so strictly isn’t always exciting, but it’s helping me stay grounded and productive. I’m proud of myself for sticking to it, especially when distractions are everywhere.

For tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going. Maybe I’ll squeeze in a workout before class — I’ve been missing that lately. Also, I want to spend some time reviewing notes from today’s classes so I’m not scrambling later. Overall, steady and focused is the way to go. Looking forward to it.
