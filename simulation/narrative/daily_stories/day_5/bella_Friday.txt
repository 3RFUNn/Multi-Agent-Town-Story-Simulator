Friday, [Date]

Today was pretty much a day where I stuck closely to my schedule—maybe a bit more than usual, actually. I woke up at the student accommodation and had breakfast there, which is always a quiet moment before the busy day starts. I appreciate how routine gives me a sense of control, especially when so much else can feel overwhelming sometimes.

After breakfast, I headed to the college campus for my morning classes. The campus was fairly normal, nothing surprising, though I noticed a bit of a crowd that blocked my usual path, so I had to find a different way around. It was a little annoying, but I reminded myself not to get too worked up over it. I arrived on time and focused on my classes. Being in those classes, I was determined to really absorb the material. Sometimes I get distracted, but today I felt pretty good about staying on track.

Lunchtime took me downtown to the café. It was nice to change the scenery a bit, though I stayed mostly to myself, just quietly eating and watching people come and go. I think I’m still getting used to socializing in public spaces—it’s not exactly my comfort zone, but I try to push myself a little.

The afternoon was back at college for more classes. I had to get caught up on some stuff, so I really buckled down. I like being conscientious about my studies, even if it means missing out on spontaneous things. It’s just how I feel most comfortable managing my time.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation. The day felt a bit repetitive in some ways, but that’s okay. I know that following my schedule helps me keep things manageable. After dinner, I went to the central park for the scheduled social time. Charlie Davis came over several times to chat. Our conversations were nice—nothing too deep, but pleasant enough. I’m glad for the interaction, even if I have to remind myself to stay open. Socializing is still a little draining, but those small talks help me feel connected without being overwhelmed.

Now, I’m back home, ready to sleep. The day was full but steady. I feel a bit tired but also satisfied that I followed through on what I set out to do. I realize that sticking to my schedule like this helps me stay grounded, especially with everything else going on.

For tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum but maybe try to notice the little things I usually overlook—like a new book at the library or a quiet spot on campus to study. It might be nice to add a small change to the routine without losing the structure I rely on.

That’s it for today. Time to get some rest.
