Friday, April 26

Today was a pretty typical day for me, honestly. I stuck to my schedule like always, which somehow feels both comforting and a bit... boring? But hey, at least I’m consistent. Woke up slow at home, which was honestly perfect. No rush, no pressure, just lounging around and letting my lazy side take over for a bit. I’m definitely an introvert, so those slow mornings where I can be by myself and not have to talk or do anything too demanding are honestly some of my favorite times.

After my slow morning, it was time for late breakfast at the downtown cafe. I like that place — nothing fancy, just a quiet little spot where I can sit and watch people without having to join in. Took my time with a coffee and some toast, feeling pretty content just being there. No need for anything complicated or big plans; simplicity suits me best.

Then I headed over to the business office for minimal work. Minimal is the keyword here. I’m not one to get caught up in a ton of tasks or meetings, so I made sure to keep my workload light, just the essentials. It’s funny how being spontaneous fits in with being lazy and introverted — I don’t plan much ahead, but I’m also not someone who pushes themselves constantly. Just enough to get by and then some room to breathe.

Around mid-afternoon, I took a coffee break back at the downtown cafe. It’s like a little ritual now. I enjoy these small pauses in the day, even if it’s just sitting quietly with my drink, scrolling on my phone or watching the world go by. I don’t mind being alone in public; it’s different from being alone at home where I can really relax.

Back at the office, I wrapped up my work for the day. Nothing strenuous, just finishing up what needed doing. I guess “follow my schedule” was the only thing I really decided to do today. That feels like enough sometimes, even if it sounds a little dull on paper.

After work, I was supposed to socialize at the park. The path to central park was blocked, which annoyed me a little — detours are not my favorite. But I found a new spot nearby and ended up running into Alex Rodriguez. We started chatting, and honestly, it was nice. I’m usually not big on social interactions, but it was a relaxed conversation, nothing too intense or draining, which I appreciated. It reminded me that even as an introvert, a little connection now and then doesn’t hurt.

Eventually, I headed back home to sleep. The day felt routine but steady — following the schedule gave me a sense of order, even if it wasn’t always exciting. I’m okay with that. Sometimes it’s nice to just have a plan to lean on.

For tomorrow, I’m thinking maybe I’ll try to shake things up a little bit. Not too much, because I like my comfort zone, but maybe a small spontaneous move or two. Nothing huge, just to remind myself that I don’t always have to stick so rigidly to the schedule. We’ll see how that goes. For now, time to rest up and recharge. 

Goodnight.
