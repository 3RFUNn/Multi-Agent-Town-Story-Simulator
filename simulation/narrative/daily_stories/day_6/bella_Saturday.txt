Saturday, [Date]

Today was pretty much a textbook example of me sticking to my schedule, which honestly feels both reassuring and a little repetitive. I woke up at the student accommodation, took my time to sleep in a bit since it’s Saturday, nothing urgent calling me early. I’m glad I gave myself that extra rest — sometimes I get too caught up in routine and forget that slowing down is necessary.

After getting up, I headed downtown to that cafe I like for brunch. The place was fairly quiet, which I appreciate. I sat by the window, ordered my usual — something simple but comforting — and let myself just be for a while. It’s easy to get lost in my thoughts and the little things when I’m alone in a space like that. I noticed a couple of people chatting and laughing, and while I didn’t join in, it felt good to be around that low hum of life without having to say much myself.

Once brunch was done, I went over to campus for the study session. I managed to focus better than I expected. I brought my notes and a list of things I wanted to tackle, and I stuck with it. There’s something satisfying about ticking off items on my to-do list, especially when I’m conscientious like this. It’s quieter on weekends, which helps me concentrate, though sometimes I wonder if I should push myself to engage more with classmates. But then again, I’m not sure if I’m ready for that — for now, the solitude suits me.

Later, it was time to exercise. I actually ran into a bit of a hiccup when my usual path to the gym was blocked. I had to find a new route, which was a bit frustrating but also kind of interesting. I guess small changes keep things from being too monotonous. I admit, I was really hungry by then, so I stopped at the cafe again to grab something to eat before working out. That meal definitely hit the spot and gave me the energy boost I needed.

The gym itself was steady — nothing too intense, but enough to feel like I accomplished something. I prefer working out alone anyway; it helps me clear my head. After the session, I went to the grocery store to pick up dinner supplies. I like the routine of walking through the aisles, checking my list, making sure I have everything I need. It’s oddly calming and helps me feel prepared for the week ahead.

In the evening, I headed to the park for some social time, which is usually the hardest part of my day. My path to central park was blocked, so I had to find another spot, but that led me to bump into Diana Kim. We ended up having a nice chat. It was unexpectedly pleasant — not too long, just enough to feel connected without being overwhelmed. I appreciate those moments with people who understand my quieter nature.

Finally, I made my way back home, feeling pretty content with how the day unfolded. Following my schedule so strictly might seem repetitive to some, but for me, it’s a structure that keeps my mind calm and my days productive. I’m curious to see how I can slowly stretch my comfort zone, maybe by spending a bit more time around others or trying out something new in my routine.

For tomorrow, I want to stay mindful of balancing productivity and rest. Maybe I’ll try exploring a new cafe or take a different route on my way to campus. Small changes might help me stay curious without throwing off the schedule I rely on so much. Time will tell.
