Saturday, finally a day to stick to my plan and get things done right. Woke up at home, pretty much in line with my usual Saturday routine. Since my budget’s tight—only $9 to work with—I had to skip the gym and the usual post-workout café meal. Not ideal for someone like me who’s big on fitness and healthy eating, but I reminded myself that sometimes you just have to adapt and make it work.

Started the morning with some meal prepping at home. It’s actually kind of satisfying to get in the kitchen and put together meals for the next few days, even if it means being a little creative with what I’ve got on hand. I kept it balanced as much as possible given the budget constraints—lean proteins, some veggies, and rice to keep me fueled. Not gourmet, but it’ll do.

Later, I headed over to Central Park for some outdoor activities. It’s one of my favorite spots in town to stay active when the gym isn’t an option. The fresh air and open space do wonders for my mood and energy. I definitely felt the hunger creeping in, so I made a quick stop at a café nearby and grabbed something simple but filling. That meal really hit the spot and gave me the boost I needed to keep moving.

After finishing up some outdoor exercise, I stuck around the park for a bit of socializing, which is always good for me. I caught up with Charlie Davis for a quick chat—always good vibes there—and then later started a conversation with Alex Rodriguez. It’s nice to connect, especially on days when everything feels a bit routine. Both of them helped me remember that even when life feels repetitive, the people around you keep it interesting.

Ended the day back at home with a healthy dinner, sticking to my plan despite the financial squeeze. I’m proud I didn’t stray from what I know works for my body and mind. It’s a challenge, but I’m learning how to prioritize and be conscientious with my resources without letting it drag me down.

Now, as I’m winding down and ready to hit the sack, I’m thinking about tomorrow. The key takeaway today is resilience—sticking to my schedule and values even when things aren’t perfect financially. I want to keep this momentum, maybe find some creative ways to stay active and eat well without breaking the bank. Maybe some home workouts or checking out community events that are free or low-cost.

All in all, a solid Saturday. Now, time to rest up and tackle Sunday with the same focus.
