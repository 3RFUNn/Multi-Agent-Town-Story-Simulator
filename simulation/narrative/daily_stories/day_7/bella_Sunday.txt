Sunday, [Date]

Today was very much a “follow the plan” kind of day. I stuck closely to my schedule from start to finish, which felt... predictable, but also kind of comforting in its own way. I tend to like having that structure, even if it means things sometimes get a bit repetitive.

I started off waking up at the student accommodation. It’s nice to have my own space there, quiet enough to recharge. I stayed in bed a little longer than usual since it’s Sunday and I’m allowed that luxury. Eventually, I got up and headed to the downtown cafe for brunch, as planned. Only problem was, I realized I had just 90 cents in my wallet, which wasn’t nearly enough for anything on the menu. That was frustrating, but not surprising. I’ve been trying to be more conscientious with my money, but it’s hard when there’s so much I want to do and not enough funds to back it up.

Since brunch was out of the question, I went straight to the college campus for my study session. I focused on my coursework for a few hours. It was a bit tough concentrating knowing I was hungry, but I managed to push through. Eventually, I got really hungry and decided to go back to the cafe for something small. Luckily, I was able to get a modest meal that hit the spot and made me feel a lot better. It reminded me how important it is to eat even when things are tight.

After studying, I wanted to get some exercise in but, again, I couldn’t afford the gym fee. That’s been a constant hurdle — money’s tight, and I keep having to skip activities I know would be good for me. I might need to think about some free ways to stay active around town or at home.

Later in the afternoon, per my schedule, I went to the park to socialize a bit. Socializing isn’t exactly my favorite thing — being an introvert means I usually prefer quiet and solitude — but I know it’s good for me to get out sometimes. Fiona Walsh came over and we had a nice chat. It was pleasant, not exhausting, which was a relief. I appreciate that she’s patient and understands my quieter nature.

Once our conversation wrapped up, I decided it was time to head home. I arrived back just in time to follow my evening routine and get ready to sleep at home. The day felt long but productive — I managed to do most of what I set out to do, despite the little financial and social challenges.

Reflecting on today, I realize how much I rely on sticking to my schedule to keep things manageable. It helps me stay grounded, especially when I feel a bit overwhelmed or uncertain. Tomorrow, I want to try planning some simple, free activities that might brighten things up without stressing my budget. Maybe a walk in the park alone or catching up on a book I’ve been curious about. Small steps. I’m okay with that.

Here’s to a better day tomorrow.
