Sunday, [Date]

Today was one of those days where I really tried to stick to my schedule, and for the most part, I did. I woke up early at the student accommodation, feeling pretty determined to follow through with my plans. It was nice to sleep in a bit there, but I had a lot on my plate, so I stayed focused.

The morning kicked off with brunch plans at the downtown cafe, but that didn’t quite pan out the way I wanted. I realized pretty quickly that I only had $4.50 to my name, which isn’t enough for most brunch spots around here. That was a bit frustrating because I was craving something good and nutritious to fuel the day, especially since I’m really trying to maintain my fitness and energy levels. I couldn’t splurge on a nice meal, so I had to keep it simple and stick to what I had.

After brunch fell through, I headed over to the college campus for my planned study sessions. I spent a solid chunk of time there working through assignments and getting some reading done. I felt productive, which was a relief because I’ve been trying to keep up with my coursework without letting it pile up. The campus was busy as usual, but I managed to focus pretty well. Midway through, my hunger kicked in again, so I made a quick stop at the cafe on campus. I got a basic meal that hit the spot and gave me a little boost. Feeling better after that definitely helped me get back on track with studying.

Later, I wanted to get some exercise in, but the gym wasn’t an option today. With only $4.50 in my pocket, paying for the gym was out of the question. That was disappointing because exercise is such an important part of my routine and how I keep my mind clear. Instead, I decided to keep moving by walking around campus and doing some bodyweight exercises outside. It’s not the same as the gym, but it’s better than nothing, and I find that fresh air helps me clear my head, too.

In the afternoon, according to my schedule, it was time to socialize at the park. I was really looking forward to that, hoping to catch up with some friends and just have some light-hearted conversation. Unfortunately, my usual path to Central Park was blocked several times, which was annoying and threw me off a bit. I ended up running into Ethan Brooks though, which was a nice surprise. We had a good chat, just catching up on life and sharing some laughs. It was a good reminder of why social connections are important, especially on days when other things don’t go exactly as planned.

Eventually, I decided it was time to head home and get some rest. I arrived feeling a bit tired but content that I had stuck to my schedule and made the best of the day. I kept repeating to myself the importance of following my plan, even when things don’t go perfectly — like the brunch and gym situations today.

Reflecting on the day, I realize I need to be a little more flexible with my budget and maybe plan meals and workouts that don’t depend on spending money. There’s definitely room for creativity here—maybe more home-cooked meals or outdoor workouts that don’t cost a thing. I’m going to think about that tomorrow and maybe jot down some ideas so I’m better prepared next time.

For now, I’m ready to get some good sleep and tackle the week ahead with the same conscientious attitude. Tomorrow, I’ll try to balance sticking to my schedule with being kind to myself when plans have to shift. It’s all about progress, not perfection.

Goodnight,
