Sunday felt pretty routine but steady, which honestly suits me just fine. I stuck closely to my schedule all day—no surprises, just the way I like it. Getting up and following through on my plans makes me feel productive and in control, even if some parts get a little repetitive.

The morning started at home with some meal prep, which was necessary since I’m working with a tight budget—only $9 in my pocket today. Not enough to hit the gym for an intensive workout or to grab a post-workout meal at a café, so I had to make do with what I had at home. It’s not ideal, especially for someone like me who’s into fitness and likes to fuel properly, but I reminded myself that being conscientious about my money is just as important. I focused on prepping healthy-ish meals with what was available. Nothing fancy, but enough to keep me going.

Later, I headed to Central Park for some outdoor activities. It was nice to get some fresh air and move around without spending a dime. The park was lively as usual, which always lifts my spirits because I’m pretty extroverted and enjoy being around people—even if just in the background. Midway through, hunger hit harder than I expected, so I broke my no-café plan and grabbed a quick bite there. That meal really hit the spot and gave me the energy boost I needed to keep enjoying the park.

Afterward, I spent some time socializing back at the park. Diana Kim stopped by, and we ended up having a nice chat. She’s always easy to talk to, and catching up with her felt good. I appreciate those moments because they remind me that even on busy or budget-tight days, social connections keep me grounded and motivated.

Eventually, I decided it was time to head home for a healthy dinner and to wind down. Even though I had to skip the gym and eat a little differently due to money constraints, I stuck to my schedule without straying. That kind of discipline feels rewarding, like I’m taking care of myself in more ways than just physical fitness.

I wrapped up the day back at home, ready to get some good sleep. Repeating the same routine—arriving home and settling into sleep mode—felt oddly comforting, like I’m respecting my body’s need to recharge for the week ahead.

Looking ahead, I’m thinking about finding some creative ways to keep my fitness routine going without breaking the bank. Maybe more bodyweight workouts at home or running in the park. Also, I want to plan my meals better to stretch my budget while still eating healthy. It’s not always easy, but I’m committed to balancing my fitness goals with financial reality. Tomorrow’s another chance to get closer to that balance.
