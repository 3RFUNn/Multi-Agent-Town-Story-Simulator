Monday, what a day. Stuck to my schedule like always—no surprises there. Woke up and decided to hit the downtown cafe for my usual morning coffee. Well, that plan hit a snag pretty quick because I realized I only had five bucks on me, which honestly isn’t enough for my typical caffeine fix there. Had to swallow that one and just moved on, sticking to the plan no matter what. Gotta keep grinding, right?

I made my way to the business office afterward. Spent most of my morning and afternoon working non-stop. Definitely one of those marathon work sessions where your brain just stays locked in. It’s exhausting but satisfying at the same time. I love the feeling of productivity, even if it means sitting at my desk for hours. Around midday, hunger hit hard, so I headed back to the downtown cafe for lunch. That meal really hit the spot and gave me the boost I needed to power through the afternoon. After lunch, back to the office I went—more work, more focus, no distractions.

Later in the day, I planned to hit the gym for my evening workout, but the path to the gym was blocked. Had to find a workaround, but I made it eventually. The workout was solid—exactly what I needed to unwind after the long work hours. Feeling sore but good.

Dinner was back at the downtown cafe, which I usually look forward to, but money was tight again. I only had $19 to my name, so I had to be smart about what I ordered. Not ideal, but it kept me going nonetheless.

After dinner, I went to central park to socialize a bit. I ran into Fiona Walsh first and had a quick chat, which was nice, then caught up with Ethan Brooks. Conversations like that remind me why I love this town so much—there's always someone to talk to, and it keeps me energized. Unfortunately, nightlife at the bar was off the table tonight because of funds, which was a bummer. Would’ve liked to unwind with a few drinks and some music, but that’ll have to wait.

Finally, I wrapped up the night heading home. I’m wiped out but feeling accomplished. It’s days like this that remind me how much I rely on routine and staying busy, but also how important it is to keep connected with people—even if it’s just a quick catch-up in the park.

Tomorrow, I want to see if I can squeeze in a little more fun or maybe find a way to save up better so I’m not stressing about cash every single day. Still, I’m proud that I kept at my schedule and managed to balance work, social time, and self-care. Here’s to finding that sweet spot between hustling hard and enjoying life a bit more.
