Monday, [Date]

Today was a pretty typical day for me, mostly following my schedule closely as usual. I woke up at the student accommodation and had breakfast there—nothing special, but it’s comforting to start the day in a familiar place with a routine I can count on. It helps keep me grounded, especially since I’m naturally more introverted and like to know what to expect.

I headed to college for my morning classes. The path was blocked a couple of times, which was a bit frustrating, but I managed to find alternative routes without too much trouble. I’m grateful I’m not in a rush most of the time, so detours don’t stress me out too much. When I finally arrived on campus, I really focused on my classes and tried to absorb as much as I could. I know I need to catch up on some topics, so I kept reminding myself to concentrate.

Lunch was supposed to be at the downtown cafe, but again, there was some blockage on the way, so I had to find another place to eat. I stuck to my plan and ate at the cafe eventually. It’s nice to have a quiet spot to recharge midday. I noticed that I tend to prefer smaller, quieter places rather than busy, noisy ones. It’s probably part of my introverted nature, but it helps me feel calm and more present.

After lunch, it was back to college for afternoon classes. I stayed on campus for the rest of the day and really put in the effort to catch up with my studies. Staying disciplined is important to me, even though sometimes it feels like a lot. I noticed that a few people came over to chat during the day, including Charlie Davis, Ethan Brooks, and Fiona Walsh. I had some nice conversations with them, which felt surprisingly pleasant. I’m not always quick to initiate social interactions, but when people come over, I try to be open. It’s a balance between keeping my space and being friendly.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation, and I kept following my schedule strictly. I was hoping to socialize at the park afterward, but that didn’t work out—my path to Central Park was blocked multiple times, so I couldn’t really get there. Instead, I spent some more time focusing on my own things. It’s sometimes a little disappointing to miss out on social time, but I’m okay with it. I know my limits and don’t want to force myself into situations that feel overwhelming.

Eventually, I decided it was time to head home to sleep. The quiet comfort of home is where I feel most at ease, especially after a busy day. I told myself to stick to my schedule, and I did, arriving home without any issues. I’m grateful for a steady routine—it gives me peace of mind even when unexpected things come up.

Reflection for tomorrow: I think I want to try to be a little more flexible about socializing, maybe find a way to connect with others without feeling like I’m overstepping my boundaries. Also, I want to keep up my focus on studying but remember to take breaks and not get too caught up in just following the schedule. I’m curious to see how small changes might affect my day.

Overall, it was a good day. Nothing too exciting, but steady and manageable. That’s enough for me.
