Monday, well, what a day. I pretty much stuck to my schedule like always, which is both impressive and kind of boring, if I’m being honest with myself. Woke up to a slow morning at home — which felt perfect. No rush, just the usual lazy start where I barely moved more than necessary. It’s nice having that little cushion of calm before heading out, even if I’m an introvert who would rather stay put all day.

Eventually, it was time for my late breakfast at the downtown cafe. I like that spot — it’s just busy enough to feel alive but not overwhelming, so I can enjoy my coffee and food without too much social energy drained. Plus, the food’s decent and the baristas know me by now, which is nice in a low-key way. I didn’t really chat with anyone much, just kept to myself, scrolling through my phone while sipping.

After that, it was minimal work at the office. “Minimal” is definitely the right word. I wasn’t really feeling productive today — more like the bare minimum to show up and pretend I’m working. It’s funny how I can switch from being totally lazy at home to just pushing through the motions in the office. I’m definitely not one to overdo it, and honestly, I think that’s just who I am.

Mid-afternoon, I took a coffee break back at the cafe downtown. I find those small breaks are pretty necessary to keep me going, even if it’s just sitting there quietly, watching people pass by. Then back to the office to finish up work for the day. The workday dragged a bit, but I kept telling myself to just follow the schedule, and that’s what I did.

Evening came, and it was time to socialize — kind of. The plan was to go to central park, but my usual path was blocked. So I had to find a new spot. I ended up chatting with a few people — Ethan Brooks and Alex Rodriguez popped up for conversations, which was actually kind of nice. Not too long or intense, just enough to feel connected without going overboard. I also talked with Bella Chen for a bit. Socializing is always a bit of a gamble for me since I’m more of an introvert, but these chats felt easy and unforced, which I appreciate.

Afterward, I decided it was time to head home and sleep. Funny enough, my path home was also blocked at first, which was a bit annoying, but I found my way eventually. I arrived home feeling ready to just crash and relax for the night. Honestly, evenings at home are my favorite — I can just be myself and take it slow without any pressure.

Overall, today was very much a “follow the plan” kind of day. I didn’t do anything too exciting or exhausting, which suits me just fine. I’m happy with how the social moments went — low key and manageable — and the slow mornings and minimal work balanced out nicely with my lazy, introverted vibe.

For tomorrow, I’m thinking maybe I’ll try to shake things up just a little. Not too much, but maybe a small change in routine or a spontaneous decision to do something different. Although, knowing me, I’ll probably stick to following the schedule again. It’s comforting in its own way. We’ll see.
