Tuesday, [Date]

Today was one of those days where I really stuck to my schedule—no deviations, no spontaneous breaks, just a full-on follow-through of what I planned. Honestly, it felt kind of comforting, even if it was a bit repetitive. I woke up at the student accommodation and had breakfast there, just the usual quiet start with my thoughts to myself. I like that part of the morning—simple and predictable.

After breakfast, I headed over to the college campus for my morning classes. It was a bit frustrating because my usual path was blocked, so I had to find a new way. That little hiccup threw me off for a moment, but I managed to adjust without too much stress. I was ready to learn, focused, and mentally prepared to absorb everything. The classes went by steadily; nothing too exciting, but I made sure to pay attention and keep up because I want to stay on top of my studies.

Lunchtime was supposed to be at the downtown cafe, but again, that plan got interrupted because the path was blocked there too. I had to find somewhere else to eat, which was a little inconvenient but gave me a chance to explore a different spot nearby. I’m glad I stuck to my schedule even when things didn’t go as planned—it felt like a small victory.

The afternoon was back to classes at college. Same routine, same focus. I really tried to get caught up on my studies, knowing that if I don’t keep this consistency, it’ll pile up quickly. I’m a bit exhausted but satisfied with how much I managed to concentrate. It’s not easy being an introvert in a busy environment, but I’m learning to navigate it on my own terms.

Dinner was back at the student accommodation, a quiet meal where I could decompress. After eating, I headed over to Central Park for some social time. I usually keep to myself, but today I had a few conversations that felt surprisingly nice. Charlie Davis stopped by for a chat, which was casual and easy. Then Diana Kim came over twice, and we had some nice talks. It’s funny how social interactions can feel both draining and fulfilling at the same time for me. I’m glad I stayed open to those moments, even if I’m naturally more reserved.

After wrapping up my time at the park, I made my way home. It was a relief to finally settle in my own space, where I can rest properly. I’ve realized how important it is for me to sleep at home, in my own bed—it helps me reset more than anywhere else.

Looking back, today was about persistence and sticking to the plan, even when small obstacles popped up. It wasn’t flashy or exciting, but it was steady and productive. I think that’s what I need right now: routine and reliability. Tomorrow, I want to keep this momentum going but maybe try to give myself a little more flexibility—perhaps carve out some time just to explore or indulge my curiosity a bit more. It’s easy to get caught up in the schedule and forget to slow down and enjoy the little things.

For now, I’m ready to sleep and recharge.
